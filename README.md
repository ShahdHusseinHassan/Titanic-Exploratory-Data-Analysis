# 🛳 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python.  
It includes data cleaning, visualization, and analysis to understand survival patterns based on passenger class, gender, and age.  
This project is part of my **Elevvo Data Analysis Internship**.

---

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
**Handling Missing Data:**
- Filled missing `Age` values with the mean age of passengers.  
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with the most common port (mode).  
- Dropped the `Cabin` column due to excessive missing values.

---

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis focused on understanding which factors influenced passenger survival.  
- Analyzed survival rates by **Gender** and **Passenger Class**.  
- Explored relationships between numeric features using a correlation heatmap.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib

---

### 📊 Key Insights
- Females had a much higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~19%).  
- First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (~63%), while third-class passengers had the lowest (~24%).  
- Around 38% of all passengers survived overall.

### 📈 Visuals
- Survival count distribution  
- Survival by gender  
- Survival by passenger class  
- Correlation heatmap

---

### 🧠 Summary
- **Gender** was one of the strongest predictors of survival.  
- **Passenger class** had a strong effect on survival — first-class passengers were significantly more likely to survive.

📈 Visualizations

Here are some of the visual insights generated from the analysis:
1. Survival Rate by Gender
Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males
